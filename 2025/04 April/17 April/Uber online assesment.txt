In the Uber online assessment link , 
i got the problem 

where given a string s = "absbabsbabsbssac" , t = "abs" 

check how many substrings of s , match with that of t , 

this algorigthm i learnt in O(n + m ) solution , but i forgot , it was very embarrssing , 
i had to implement O(n*m) solution , which was embarrsing , i have to learn the better soln
