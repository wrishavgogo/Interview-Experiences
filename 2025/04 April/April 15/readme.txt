Tomorrow is my High Level Design interview of Tekion 
and i asked Mayank to take my high level design interview , and i realised that i have not revised it for so long that i forgot lot of the concepts 

Two things i learnt today

1. Make a proper revision plan to revise things properly and have a revision interval period daily , hld ,LLD , Leetcode each 1 problem daily 
2. I realised I act on emotions more than my plans , tomorrow is my High Level design interview yet am studying DSA sparse segment tree today .. why?????
i need to fix this behaviour about myself from now onwards. Act on the plan rather than emotion 
Give each interview sincerely to learn from it and improve from it . 
Have a plan to do divide the day into two sections 


3 day cycle 

Day1 -> DSA , LLD , revise HLD
Day2 -> LLD , HLd , REVISE dsa
Day3 -> DSA , HLD , revise LLD 

this loop keeps on repeating , revision is a must , or else you wont improve for sure 
and act on plan not on emotions
