amazing learning , when doing mis integration in v4 , 
in v4 we were planning to use sis of freq algo , but were wondering , what happens 
if we wanted to add an attribute in sis in v4 , we will have to change in frq algo as well or not , 


my learnings 

https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html
mcse -lite v5 and solution generation both picking my custom mcse-commons version. , which i added in the pom of mcse-lite

we should be good , i guess , but in some places its showing its risky to do it like this


i also learnt about maven helper plugin Adarsh taught me . 
Adarsh taught this , 
so wherever the dependency is going to be get used , I can use it to get dependency tree  like the one shared in images
