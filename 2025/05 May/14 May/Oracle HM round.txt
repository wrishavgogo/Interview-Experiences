Most impactful work talk about preferred Day feature ,



Oracle Health Migrating from Old Legacy to new Oracle EHR -> want to explore this 



I did not have full proof answer to the question : 

Did your code ever cause any incident and how did you handle it ? was it a quick turn around 
I told them about the sfs node level reservation scenario where sfs went from dfs
