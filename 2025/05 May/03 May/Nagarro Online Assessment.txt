Today was Naggaro interview experience 

I did a bizzare mistake , i only focussed on solving assessment 
my mind was speaking very loud during that time , and i was not focusing on what was in front of me.
What ended up happening is i only ended up attempting the DSA section and missed out on the MCQ part
I think next time whenever i go into overthinking i will remember this incident and will bounce back into present as soon as possible 




But the DSA questions where good , I will note down however much i remember 

Q1) -> 

it had to do with something related to permutation and combination 
you will be given k1 -> h
you will be given k2 -> t
you have to respond with the possible permutations for this ,---> I remembered the formula (k1 + k2)!/k1!*k2!

Q2) -> you have to split the array in such a way so that each segment has equal number of elements 
		and are in the same order

test case 1
[1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3]  -> [1 , 2 , 3 ] ,  [ 1 , 2 , 3] , [ 1 , 2 , 3]
ans = 3 , so len / minFreq of elements
1 -> 3
2 -> 3
3 -> 3

test case 2
[1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5] -> [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5] -> you cannot split this anymore 
ans = 1


Q3) This was kind of a dp problem 
given a number in string format = 125 

you can place any number of '+' in b/w the digits , you have to find out total sum you can get by placing '+' 's in b/w

125 
1+25 
12+5
1+2+5 

add all these into your answer and that will be your answer 
I tried backtracking to solve it , but was unable to solve many cases for it 
Because the number can be large -> String format 

So have to try thinking in terms of String format
