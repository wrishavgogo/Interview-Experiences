creating interview experience format

One important thing that i learnt from Tekion Interview round (in-person) , is that i have to revise things each day 
If you are doing DSA one day , then on that day revise HLD 
the day you are doing LLD , on that day revise DSA questions marked as revise 
the day you are doing HLD , revise LLD 

mix and match you have to do ,
